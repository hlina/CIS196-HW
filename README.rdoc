In this assignment, the app was updated to say the following, adding a line with my name:
"home#index
Find me in app/views/home/index.html.erb

Lina Huang".

Since Github, Heroku, and Rails are all very new to me, I had many struggles understanding and following the instructions. However, by going to office hours and receiving much help and guidance, everything went smoothly.
